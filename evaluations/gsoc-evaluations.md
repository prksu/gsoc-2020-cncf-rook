# Evaluations

Google Summer of Code has three evaluations. Here are evaluation notes from my mentors [Ashish Ranjan](https://github.com/ashishranjan738) [Jared Watts](https://github.com/jbw976/) and [Rohan Gupta](https://github.com/rohan47)

## First Evaluation

### Mentor (Jared Watts) Notes:

Ahmad has continually accomplished his goals at a pace that exceeds the planned project timeline for the summer. He is very effective and efficient at designing a solution, troubleshooting issues, and implementing a solution to completion. This is a great asset to the project and since he is running ahead of the timeline the student can take up some more enhancement features beyond the originally planned work. For example, we have discussed also taking on an issue with managing disk quota for the NFS server. Ahmad can also consider to start contributing before the end of the summer to other parts of the Rook project as well, for example the Rook common storage framework, or more storage providers like EdgeFS, Ceph, CockroachDB, Cassandra, etc.

One area where Ahmad can continue to invest in is communication abilities, both written and spoken. Ahmad understands most technical concepts that he comes across, but has some difficulty conversing about them rapidly with the mentors. This is of course understandable since English is not Ahmad's first language, and we are more than happy to continue investing time and resources to work through and improve communication. I would encourage Ahmad to do the following:
* provide more frequent status updates to the mentors (Slack is fine), which will be a forcing function to collect, process, and communicate his ideas and experiences more consistently
* take a more active role in our weekly sync ups to share his observations and experiences proactively, instead of only directly responding to the mentors direct questions. I'd like Ahmad to feel encouraged and supported to speak more freely and hone his spoken communication skills through practice

## Second Evaluation

### Mentor (Jared Watts) Notes:

Ahmad is still doing fantastic work with the technical solutions and implementations and is working at an impressive pace for this summer. It's great to see him consistently ahead of schedule and still showing motivation and excitement, instead of just wanting to get the minimum completed. From the feedback about communication in evaluation 1, we have seen Ahmad start to be more expressive with verbal communication, so this is a good thing that he is making more effort and putting himself out there more often. That is great to see and will result in his verbal communication skills improving further. We would like to see similar and further improvement in written communication, for example design docs. It would be great to invest in deeper content in the design docs where technical ideas get explained with more details and justification, instead of simply being presented at face value. A good way to think about a design doc is "what would the experience reading this doc be for someone who doesn't already understand this topic as well as the author?". Likely, more background information and context is needed to set up a design doc for consumption by wider audiences. This would be a good place to continue improving for Ahmad.
